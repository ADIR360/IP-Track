Project Architecture
The Vulnerability Tracker project architecture is designed to deliver comprehensive insights into website security and performance by integrating multiple scanning tools and APIs. The system is built with a modular approach, ensuring scalability, reliability, and ease of integration with various external services.
1. System Overview
The system architecture consists of several key components:
●	Frontend (ReactJS): The user interface is built with React, providing an interactive dashboard where users can view detailed insights about a website. This includes sections for IP information, SSL chain, DNS records, server location, open ports, and more.
●	Backend (Node.js/Express): The backend serves API requests from the frontend, processes data, and interacts with the database. It also handles communication with external APIs for additional data retrieval and analysis.
●	Database (MongoDB): All collected data is stored in a MongoDB database. This includes historical data on IPs, DNS records, SSL certificates, and more, enabling the system to perform trend analysis and provide historical insights.
●	External APIs:
○	Google Cloud API: Used to retrieve quality metrics for a website, enhancing the depth of analysis provided by the system.
○	Shodan API: This API provides information on associated hostnames for a given domain, which is crucial for identifying potential security risks.
○	WhoAPI: Offers comprehensive Whois records, providing detailed domain information that supports the identification of potential vulnerabilities.
●	Scanning Modules: The system includes various scanning modules that perform specific checks and analyses:
○	IP Information: Retrieves and analyzes the IP address data of a given website.
○	SSL Chain: Examines SSL certificates to ensure they are valid and properly configured.
○	DNS Records: Collects and analyzes DNS records, including TXT and A records, to ensure proper configuration and security.
○	Open Ports: Scans for open ports on the server, which could be potential entry points for attackers.
○	HTTP Security Features: Analyzes HTTP headers and other configurations to assess the website’s security posture.
○	Site Performance and Carbon Footprint: Measures the website's performance metrics and evaluates its environmental impact based on energy consumption.
2. Data Flow
1.	Data Collection: The frontend sends a request to the backend to analyze a specific website. The backend orchestrates the scanning process by invoking the relevant scanning modules and external APIs.
2.	Data Processing: The results from the scanning modules and external APIs are processed and stored in the database. The backend also performs additional analysis, such as identifying trends or anomalies in the data.
3.	Data Presentation: The processed data is sent back to the frontend, where it is displayed on the dashboard. Users can view detailed information about the website’s security, performance, and environmental impact.
3. API Configuration
To enhance the system’s capabilities, the following environmental variables can be configured:
●	GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY: For accessing Google Cloud’s site quality metrics.
●	SHODAN_API_KEY: To retrieve associated hostnames via Shodan.
●	WHO_API_KEY: For obtaining comprehensive Whois records.
Additional configuration settings include port assignments, API rate-limiting, CORS policies, and timeout limits, which ensure the system operates smoothly and securely in various environments.

4. Future Enhancements
In the future, we plan to integrate web vulnerability exploitation tools into the system, enabling us to actively test the resilience of websites against various hacking techniques. This addition will allow for comprehensive assessments of a site's defenses, providing deeper insights into its ability to withstand potential cyber attacks.
Algorithm: 
The algorithms used in our project include:
1.	Merge Sort Algorithm
○	Usage: Applied to sort data fetched from APIs and to organize packets by timestamp, size, or other criteria.
○	Logic: The algorithm divides the dataset into smaller segments, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted segments. It operates with a time complexity of O(n log n) and is suitable for large datasets. Merge sort is stable and can be parallelized for multi-threaded environments.
2.	Heap Sort Algorithm
○	Usage: Utilized for managing and sorting dynamically updated data from network streams.
○	Logic: Builds a heap data structure, then repeatedly extracts the maximum element and rebuilds the heap. Heap sort maintains a time complexity of O(n log n) and performs sorting in place, making it efficient in terms of memory usage.

System Design
The system is designed to be both robust and adaptable, using a combination of APIs and a central database to gather and analyze detailed information about websites. This approach enables us to provide insights into various aspects, such as IP details, SSL chains, DNS records, and server configurations.
One of the key components of the system is its comprehensive dashboard, which serves as the main interface for users. The dashboard is structured to present the analyzed data clearly and accessibly, giving a thorough overview of a website’s security status. Users can track a variety of important metrics, including IP information, SSL chain integrity, DNS records, and open port status. Additionally, it offers insights into site performance, security settings, and potential vulnerabilities, making it a practical tool for both technical teams and decision-makers.
Future Work: 
Scalability is a central consideration, ensuring that the system can manage increased data loads as more websites are analyzed. It’s also built to integrate smoothly with other security tools, making it a flexible addition to any organization’s security setup. In the future, we plan to incorporate web vulnerability exploitation tools. This will allow the system to test how well websites hold up against potential hacks, offering deeper insights into their security resilience.
